## Full-Stack Development Course | Portfolio Project 1

View the live project here. [Console-Origin](https://newo88.github.io/p1console-origin/index.html)

The purpose of this site is to give the visitor an insite to all the different generations of there favourite console. 
The site is based around the three main contenders in the market today Nintendo, Playstation and Microsoft. They are greeted on the home page with the qustion "Where did they Start?" With the main commercials from the launch of each of the company's first console. Under the commercial they can then click on the logo for the console they want to find out more about. When they go to the page they are looking for, the console are layed out from first released to last. Each section has four parts the start up music from that console, some info about the console, a photo of the console and then some easy read stats. 




## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.
        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
        

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The three main colours i used are blue black and white. I keep the colour scheme simple as not to take away from the photos of the consoles. Most of the photos have a white background and the console's them selves are mainly black and white in colour. The background colour has a gradient of light blue to dark blue so when the user is scrolling down through the page its not just the same block colour. 

    -   #### Typography
        -   The Roboto font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Roboto is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
    
   ### Wireframes

- The wireframes for the project can be found here [Wireframe](https://github.com/newo88/p1console-origin/tree/master/wireframes)



### Changes to Wireframe

- In my wire frames I had my logos and videos laid out in two rows of three. I have this changed this to three rows of two
       to keep the site more uniform.

- I also had my navigation bar to the right in mobile view but centered this to give it a more uniform look.
