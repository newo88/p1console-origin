This is the main marketing website for Code Institute. It is designed to be responsibe and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for potential students and partners.



## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.
        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
        

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are Code Insititue blue and white and black for my headings.

    -   #### Typography
        -   The Roboto font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Roboto is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
    
   ### Wireframes

     - The wireframes for the project can be found here [Wireframe](https://github.com/newo88/p1console-origin/tree/master/wireframes)


    #### Changes to Wireframe

    - In my wire frames I had my logos and videos laid out in two rows of three. I have this changed this to three rows of two
       to keep the site more uniform.

    - I also had my navigation bar to the right in mobile view but centered this to give it a more uniform look.
