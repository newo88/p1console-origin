            <p>Playstation One released in Japan in 1994 and Europe on the 9th September 1995 and was the first of the
                Playstation line of video games console. The Playstation
                was the brain child of Ken Kutaragi a Sony executive who managed one of the company's hardware
                divisions. He was later dubbed "The Father
                of Playstation". At the time
                of its release it primarily competed with the Nintendo 64 and the Sega Saturn. Fun fact. This wasn't
                Sony's first attempt at launching a video
                game console. Back in the early 1990's Sony and Nintendo teamed up to design a console called the "Super
                Nes CD-Rom" which later got cancelled.
